# terfit-price-check

# Purpose
I'm too lazy to check price of nearest gym, so I decided to write simple util, that will notify
me, when price will go down

# How to use
Execute mvnw package and you'll get executable jar.
Execute it using java -jar -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 %path_to_jar_from_previous_step%.jar

> **__NOTE:__** -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 and UTF-8 terminal/console is necessary, because
> I use cyrillic characters.
